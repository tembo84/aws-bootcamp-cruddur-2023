# Week 8 â€” Serverless Image Processing

## Required Homework
This week we used Serverless Image Processing to uplaod assets to an s3 bucket, that we could send to out application via cloudfront. We can also upload an asset to the bucket directly from our application using a presigned URL. Not only did I have to deal with the regular troubleshooting issues that I tend to cause myself, but Flask and Gitpod decided to pile-on and cause me additional headaches. These issues definitely set me back, but we joined together as a family in the bootcamp to resolve some of the issues (mainly Flask deprecation stuff). Then Andrew came to the rescue and helped us defeat the mighty Gitpod port "detecting" issue that sidelined a percentage of the bootcamp.

### Implement CDK Stack 
We started off this week by installing AWS CDK package to gitpod and implementing it to our AWS accounts. Here you can see the install process and all the packages/files listed on the directories.
