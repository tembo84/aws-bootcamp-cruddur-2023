# Week 10/11 â€” CloudFormation (CFN)

## Required Homework
This week consisted of coverting the ClickOps infrastructure to CloudFormation and SAM templates.

### Implement Cloudformation and TOML installation 
We started off this week by installing CFN and CFN-Toml packages to gitpod and implementing it to our AWS accounts. Here you can see the install process.

### Implement CFN Networking Layer
Here I create a Networking Template yaml file and a config toml file, for the purpose of implementing and identifying the Networking Stack in Cloudformation. I also create a networking Bash script to deploy the stack to AWS Cloudformation.

Here is the config.toml file.

And here is the Networking bash script used to deploy the stack.

### Implement CFN Database (RDS) Layer
Here I create a Database Template yaml file and a config toml file, for the purpose of implementing and identifying the Database Stack in Cloudformation. I also create a Database Bash script to deploy the stack to AWS Cloudformation.

### Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD) Layer
Here I create a CICD Template yaml file and also a nested codebuild yaml file (that will deploy a nested stack on cloudformation) and a config toml file, for the purpose of implementing and identifying the CICD Stack in Cloudformation. I also create a CICD Bash script to deploy the stack to AWS Cloudformation.

### Implement DynamoDB us Serverless Application Model (SAM)
First I install the SAM packages to gitpod and implementing it to our AWS accounts. Here you can see the install process.

Then I create a SAM DynamoDB Template yaml file for the purpose of implementing and identifying the DynamoDB Stack in Cloudformation.

And here are the SAM DynamoDB bash scripts used to deploy the stack. They consist of a Build Bash script, and Package bash script and a Deploy bash script as you can see from the screenshots below.

### Implement CFN Static Website Hosting for Frontend
Lastly I create a Frontend Template yaml file and a config toml file, for the purpose of implementing and identifying the Frontend Stack in Cloudformation. I also create a Frontend Bash script to deploy the stack to AWS Cloudformation.

### All Cloudformation Stacks SUCCESSFULLY Deployed
Here is a screenshot showing that all the Cloudformation Stacks that were implemented above in gitpod were successfully deployed in Cloudformation.
