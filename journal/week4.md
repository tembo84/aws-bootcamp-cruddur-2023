# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

## Required Homework
This week I focused on Databases, where I implemented databases through AWS using Postgres on AWS RDS. I was also able to create a user on my Cruddur App via AWS Cognito through the AWS RDS database.

### Create a Postgres Instance

### Save Postgres Commands to Gitpod.yml file
In order for the Postgres commands to install whenever I start a new Gitpod workspace, I installed the commands into my gitpod yaml file.

### AWS Lambda Function
I connected an AWS Lambda function to my RDS instance so that I could configure my Cruddur code to AWS.
